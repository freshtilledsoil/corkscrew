# Primary Assets

Corkscrew runs off from two base CSS and JavaScript files.

corkscrew.css & corkscrew.js: the primary files that style and provide necessary scripts to the corkscrew style guide.

corkscrew-extend.css & corkscrew-extend.js exist so that you can add your own styling and scripting extensions to your instance of corkscrew.


## Project Assets

It's recommended that project assets be duplicated into their respective corkscrew folders to simplify linking to these assets in [_corkscrew-layout.twig](https://github.com/freshtilledsoil/corkscrew/blob/master/src/_corkscrew-layout.twig).
